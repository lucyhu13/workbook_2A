                I'm Lucy, a learner with a passion for interactive media. This website is a platform for me to showcase the content, skills and ideas I have learned during my course.
                Through this site, you will be able to gain insight into my learning process in the field of interactive media. I will share the theoretical knowledge I have learned in the classroom as well as my practical application experience in my hands-on projects.

I believe that by communicating with each other, we can grow together and explore the infinite possibilities of interactive media together.
