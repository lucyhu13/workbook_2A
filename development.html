                    <p class="homepageText">After teacher introduced the assignment, I started my research on interactive websites. I have researched about some interesting interactive websites, This is an interactive storytelling website. Its main form of interaction is drag-and-drop. The style is mainly illustration lines. The large black background simplifies the picture. So, I would like to make my website focus in the middle.</p>

                    <p class="homepageText">After the class, I visited the NVG near the school, which gave me more ideas about the Interactive design. One exhibition impressed me deeply, which was Heterobota by Agnieszka Pilat. She used programming to create three Boston Dynamics robot dogs that are autonomous and learn to draw. This is a very cool thing. When painting, the robot will decide the direction of arm movement, how hard to press the canvas, and whether to draw dots or lines. The art created is unique.</p>

                    <p class="homepageText">The second week we did some activities to help us develop our ideas. The first activity we did was brainstorming and interacting. In the end, I chose the idea of a sapling because I thought it could represent my learning process and fit in well with the concept of my website.</p>

                <p class="homepageText">
                    My first page has a small sapling in the middle of the page with the words "water it to start" written on it. When the user clicks on the sapling, it will jump to the next page. The next page is a sapling that has grown taller. There are different bubbles nearby that you can click on, with different assignments written on them. I thought about how to return to the main page and drag the scissors to cut off the saplings. After the page jumps, there is the central layout of the web version.

                    <p class="homepageText">During the class we talked about the Fluid design, which allow the user to access the website by any mobile , computer. I started drawing a picture of opening the website on my phone. First, I think my icon needs to be trimmed a little bigger, and then the title a little smaller, since the phone is in portrait orientation and has space on either side.
         
                    <img class="w3_research" src="picture/fuild design.jpg" alt="1">
                    
                    <p class="homepageText">I chose the color palette and some fonts, then used Illustrator to draw the silhouettes of many plants, and simulated the web page effect I wanted in InDesign</p>

                    <img class="w3_research" src="picture/firsttry.png" alt="1">
                    <p class="homepageText"> I also had a idea for my weekly development page. My idea was that when the mouse is swiped down, the trees will slide to the left. The top row of trees does not move, find the appropriate icon and drag it to the large icon will jump to the page. But then in coding process, I found that this effect was difficult to achieve, so I changed to turning these trees into tabs. When the user clicks on each tab, the page will pop up below. </p>
                    <p class="homepageText">
                        Then started coding my web page, I created the html and css in vsc and linked them together.
                          Many of my fonts were local fonts and it was a pain to import them into vsc so I chose to search for similar fonts on the internet.
                            I chose my headline style from Google Font, I changed my plan slightly as I thought a rounder font would give a softer look.</p>

                    <img class="w3_research"src="picture/w3button.png" alt="1">
                    <p class="homepageText">I think the most difficult part is to make the tab button. I need to constantly adjust the size of the image and the position of the container, and link it to the following text. This takes me a lot of time. I learned that coding requires a lot of patience, especially if there is a little mistake, the final effect will be different.</p>
